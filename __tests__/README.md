# FlowPilot Test Suite

## Overview

This test suite ensures the security and reliability of the FlowPilot onboarding flow and core security features.

## Test Coverage

### 1. API Key Validation Tests

- ✅ Validates 64-character hexadecimal format requirement
- ✅ Rejects invalid formats (wrong length, invalid characters, etc.)
- ✅ Ensures consistent validation across all input scenarios

### 2. Security Tests

- ✅ XSS Prevention: Blocks script injection attempts
- ✅ SQL Injection Prevention: Blocks database manipulation attempts
- ✅ Input Sanitization: Validates only safe characters are accepted

### 3. Environment Configuration Tests

- ✅ Validates all required environment variables are present
- ✅ Ensures minimum security requirements (key lengths, etc.)
- ✅ Confirms proper client/server environment isolation

### 4. Content Security Policy Tests

- ✅ Validates CSP directives are properly restrictive
- ✅ Ensures secure defaults for all content sources
- ✅ Verifies proper security headers configuration

### 5. Form Validation Logic Tests

- ✅ Simulates successful validation workflows
- ✅ Tests error scenarios and edge cases
- ✅ Validates data flow between form steps

### 6. Error Handling Tests

- ✅ Network error scenarios
- ✅ Authentication failures
- ✅ Timeout conditions
- ✅ Server error responses
