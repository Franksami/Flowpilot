## 3. Features & Requirements

### Phase 1: The Command Center (Core MVP)

#### 3.1. Onboarding & Secure Connection
**Description:** A guided, multi-step onboarding process will greet first-time users, instructing them on how to retrieve and input their Webflow API key. The key will be securely stored in the browser's local storage for session persistence.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User is prompted for an API key on first visit.
- The key is validated with a test API call.
- The UI provides clear feedback on successful or failed connections.
- The application architecture is designed to easily swap local storage for a secure backend proxy in the future.

#### 3.2. Dynamic CMS Hub
**Description:** The core of the application. Users can select a site and collection to view a paginated and searchable table of all CMS items. The UI will feel instantaneous through the use of Optimistic UI updates.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All CMS items for a selected collection are displayed clearly.
- A search bar filters items by name in real-time.
- Creating, updating, or deleting an item updates the UI immediately, with network status handled in the background.
- A dynamic form correctly renders all Webflow field types (Text, Rich Text, Image, Reference, etc.).

#### 3.3. Centralized State Management
**Description:** The application state (current site, collections, items, user settings) will be managed by Zustand. This ensures data consistency, minimizes re-renders, and provides a highly responsive experience.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- A central Zustand store is the single source of truth for all global app data.
- Components subscribe to the store and reactively update.

### Phase 2: The Intelligence Layer

#### 3.4. AI Content Co-Pilot
**Description:** AI is integrated directly into the content creation workflow. An "Ask AI" feature allows users to generate content with an optional "Match Brand Voice" setting, which analyzes existing content to match tone and style.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- AI can generate long-form content for Rich Text fields.
- AI can suggest shorter text for titles or meta fields.
- The "Match Brand Voice" feature demonstrably alters the AI's output style.
- AI can generate descriptive alt-text for images based on context.

#### 3.5. Dashboard "Mission Control"
**Description:** A home dashboard that provides an overview of the connected site, including key stats, recently edited items, and AI-powered suggestions for new content.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The dashboard displays accurate counts of CMS items and assets.
- A "Recently Edited" widget links to the last 5 modified items.
- An "AI Opportunities" widget provides at least 3 relevant new content ideas.

### Phase 3: The Pro Experience

#### 3.6. Command Palette (`Cmd+K`)
**Description:** A professional, fast, and intuitive command palette, accessible via `Cmd+K`, allowing users to navigate the app and perform key actions without touching their mouse.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can search for and jump to any CMS collection.
- Users can trigger a "New Item" action for any collection.
- Users can trigger a "Publish Site" action.

#### 3.7. Pro Workflow Enhancements
