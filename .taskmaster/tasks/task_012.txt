# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Secure Local Storage for API Key
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance security for storing API keys in local storage.
# Details:
Use encryption libraries like CryptoJS to encrypt the API key before storing it in local storage. Ensure decryption occurs only when necessary for API calls.

# Test Strategy:
Test encryption and decryption processes to ensure the API key remains secure and accessible only when needed.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate Encryption Library [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add and configure a suitable encryption library (e.g., CryptoJS) to the project for handling encryption and decryption of local storage data.
### Details:
Install the CryptoJS library via npm or yarn. Import the library into the relevant modules where encryption and decryption will be performed. Ensure the library is available for both encryption and decryption logic implementation.

## 2. Implement Encryption Logic for Local Storage [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Develop functions to encrypt API keys before storing them in local storage using the integrated encryption library.
### Details:
Create a function that takes the API key as input, encrypts it using AES (or another secure algorithm) with a secret key, and stores the encrypted value in local storage. Ensure the secret key is managed securely and not hardcoded in production environments.[1][2]

## 3. Implement Decryption Logic for Local Storage [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2
### Description: Develop functions to retrieve and decrypt the API key from local storage when needed for API calls.
### Details:
Create a function that fetches the encrypted API key from local storage, decrypts it using the same secret key and algorithm, and returns the original API key for use in API requests. Handle errors gracefully if decryption fails or data is missing.[1][2]

## 4. Conduct Security Testing for Encrypted Local Storage [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.3
### Description: Test the encryption and decryption processes to ensure the API key is securely stored and only accessible when needed.
### Details:
Verify that the API key is not stored in plaintext in local storage. Attempt to access the encrypted data directly from local storage and confirm it cannot be read without decryption. Test edge cases such as missing or corrupted data. Review the implementation for potential vulnerabilities, such as exposure of the secret key or weak encryption practices.
