Conduct thorough market research to analyze the competitive landscape of Webflow CMS management tools and SaaS dashboard solutions. Develop detailed user personas based on target audience analysis (web developers, agencies, content managers) including pain points, workflows, and feature priorities. Create a comprehensive positioning strategy that differentiates FlowPilot from competitors like Webflow's native interface, third-party CMS tools, and general dashboard solutions. Develop detailed UX wireframes and user journey maps for key workflows including onboarding, CMS management, site publishing, and command palette usage. Create a design system specification that aligns with existing Shadcn/UI components while establishing FlowPilot's unique visual identity. Produce detailed feature prioritization matrix based on user research findings and competitive gaps. Develop go-to-market strategy including pricing models, target customer segments, and marketing messaging. Create comprehensive documentation including: market analysis report, user research findings, competitive feature comparison matrix, UX wireframes and prototypes, design system guidelines, and strategic roadmap recommendations. All deliverables should be research-based and provide actionable insights for product development and marketing teams.

# Test Strategy:
Validate market research through surveys and interviews with target users (minimum 20 respondents across different user segments). Conduct competitive analysis verification by testing competitor products and documenting feature gaps. Test user personas through user story mapping sessions with stakeholders. Validate UX wireframes through usability testing sessions with prototype tools like Figma or Sketch. Review positioning strategy with industry experts or potential customers for feedback. Ensure design system specifications are compatible with existing Shadcn/UI implementation by cross-referencing with current codebase. Validate go-to-market strategy through market sizing analysis and pricing research. Conduct stakeholder review sessions to ensure all deliverables meet business objectives and provide actionable insights for development prioritization.
