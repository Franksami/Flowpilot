# Task ID: 8
# Title: Enhance Pro Workflow with Keyboard Shortcuts
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add keyboard shortcuts for enhanced user workflow.
# Details:
Implement keyboard shortcuts using JavaScript event listeners. Add shortcuts like `Cmd+S` for saving items and other common actions. Ensure compatibility with different browsers.

# Test Strategy:
Test all keyboard shortcuts in various browsers to ensure they trigger the intended actions without conflicts.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Shortcut Mapping [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify and document all required keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Cmd+S for save, others for common actions). Map each shortcut to its intended application action, considering potential conflicts with browser or OS defaults.
### Details:
Create a comprehensive list of shortcuts and their corresponding actions. Ensure that chosen shortcuts do not interfere with essential browser or OS shortcuts. Document the mapping for reference in implementation and documentation phases.

## 2. Implement Event Listeners for Shortcuts [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Develop JavaScript event listeners to detect and handle the defined keyboard shortcuts, triggering the mapped actions within the application.
### Details:
Use 'keydown' event listeners and custom handler functions to capture shortcut key combinations. Prevent default browser actions where necessary. Ensure modular and maintainable code structure for easy updates and debugging.[1][2]

## 3. Test Cross-Browser Compatibility [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Test all implemented keyboard shortcuts across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and operating systems to ensure consistent behavior and resolve any conflicts or inconsistencies.
### Details:
Verify that shortcuts trigger the correct actions and do not conflict with browser or OS-level shortcuts. Address any browser-specific issues, such as modifier key differences or event handling quirks. Consider using polyfills or feature detection for enhanced compatibility.[3]

## 4. Create User Documentation for Shortcuts [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.3
### Description: Document all available keyboard shortcuts and their actions for end users, including any browser-specific notes or limitations.
### Details:
Prepare clear and accessible documentation (e.g., help page, tooltips, or onboarding guide) listing each shortcut, its function, and any relevant usage tips. Highlight any differences in shortcut behavior across browsers or platforms for user awareness.[3]
