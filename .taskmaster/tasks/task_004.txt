# Task ID: 4
# Title: Setup Centralized State Management with Zustand
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a modern centralized state management system using Zustand with 2025 best practices and React 19.x compatibility.
# Details:
Initialize Zustand with TypeScript integration and modern patterns. Create a global store with selective subscriptions, atomic updates, and proper state slicing. Implement store for current site/collection data, UI state (modals, loading, filters), user preferences, optimistic CMS updates, and command palette state. Ensure React Server Components compatibility and proper hydration consistency.

# Test Strategy:
Verify selective subscriptions minimize re-renders using React DevTools. Test state consistency across components and server/client hydration. Validate TypeScript integration and atomic state updates. Test devtools integration and persistence middleware functionality.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Zustand Store with TypeScript [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the base Zustand store using TypeScript, ensuring type safety and compatibility with React 19.x.
### Details:
Create the initial store file, define the root state interface, and ensure TypeScript types are enforced throughout the store.

## 2. Implement State Slicing for Modular Store Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Organize the store into logical slices (e.g., site/collection data, UI state, user preferences, command palette) for maintainability and scalability.
### Details:
Define separate state slices and update functions for each domain, using Zustand's recommended patterns for modular state.

## 3. Enable Selective Subscriptions [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Optimize component re-renders by allowing components to subscribe only to relevant state slices or properties.
### Details:
Implement selector functions and test that components only re-render when their subscribed state changes.

## 4. Integrate Immer for Immutable State Updates [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Enhance the store with Immer middleware to simplify immutable state updates and reduce boilerplate.
### Details:
Wrap state update functions with Immer, ensuring all mutations are handled immutably and type-safely.

## 5. Set Up Zustand Devtools Middleware [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Integrate Zustand Devtools middleware for debugging and state inspection during development.
### Details:
Configure the store to use the devtools middleware and verify state changes are visible in Redux DevTools.

## 6. Implement Persistence Middleware [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Add persistence middleware to save and restore relevant parts of the state (e.g., user preferences, UI state) across sessions.
### Details:
Configure which state slices should be persisted (e.g., to localStorage or IndexedDB) and test hydration on reload.

## 7. Add Optimistic Update Patterns [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.4
### Description: Implement optimistic updates for CMS actions, allowing UI to reflect changes immediately while handling rollback on failure.
### Details:
Design update functions that optimistically update state, trigger async actions, and revert state if the server call fails.

## 8. Ensure React Server Component Compatibility [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2, 4.6
### Description: Adapt the store for compatibility with React Server Components and Next.js App Router, ensuring hydration consistency.
### Details:
Test store usage in server and client components, handle serialization/deserialization, and resolve hydration mismatches.

## 9. Implement Atomic Update Patterns [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.4, 4.7
### Description: Ensure all state updates are atomic and consistent, preventing race conditions and partial updates.
### Details:
Use functional updates and batching where necessary to guarantee atomicity, and write tests to verify state consistency under concurrent updates.
