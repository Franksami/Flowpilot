# Task ID: 16
# Title: Plan and Document ESLint/Husky Cleanup Strategy
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a comprehensive strategy to resolve current ESLint and Husky failures without modifying production code, including issue categorization, rule exceptions, and automated cleanup approach.
# Details:
Conduct a thorough audit of current ESLint violations and Husky pre-commit hook failures across the codebase. Categorize issues into groups: auto-fixable formatting issues, rule violations requiring exceptions, and structural problems needing manual intervention. Create a detailed remediation plan that includes: 1) ESLint configuration updates with appropriate rule exceptions for legacy code patterns, 2) Custom auto-fix script using eslint --fix with targeted file patterns and rule-specific fixes, 3) Husky configuration adjustments to handle current workflow without blocking commits, 4) Documentation of temporary rule exceptions with justification and future cleanup timeline, 5) Prioritized manual refactor tasks for critical violations that cannot be auto-fixed or excepted. Ensure the strategy maintains code quality standards while providing a practical path forward that doesn't disrupt current development workflow.

# Test Strategy:
Validate the cleanup strategy by running ESLint against the current codebase to establish baseline violation counts. Test the proposed auto-fix script on a isolated branch to verify it resolves targeted issues without breaking functionality. Verify Husky configuration changes allow commits while maintaining essential quality gates. Review rule exception proposals with the development team to ensure they align with project standards. Create a test plan for manual refactor tasks to ensure they can be completed without affecting production behavior. Document success criteria including target violation reduction percentages and timeline for full compliance.
