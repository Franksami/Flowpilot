# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Initialize the Git repository and configure the project structure for FlowPilot using modern 2025 best practices.
# Details:
Create a new GitHub repository for FlowPilot. Initialize the project using Next.js 14.x with App Router and TypeScript support. Set up the modern project structure with /app directory routing, implement proper security configurations, and configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline. Use current tech stack including React 19.x with Server Components, Tailwind CSS 4.x with JIT compiler, and Zustand for state management.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the repository is accessible, the project builds successfully with Next.js 14.x and App Router, TypeScript compiles without errors in strict mode, Tailwind CSS JIT compilation works correctly, ESLint and Prettier configurations are functional, environment variables are properly configured, and CI/CD pipeline triggers on commits.
