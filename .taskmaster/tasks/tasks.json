            "details": "<info added on 2025-07-13T17:05:38.384Z>\n### Permissions Policy Research Summary (2025 Best Practices)\n\n**Goal**: Secure FlowPilot's Server Actions & CMS UI with robust role-based authorization while keeping codebase simple.\n\n#### 1. Architectural Principles\n- **Enforce on the Server first** – UI hides buttons, but Server Actions are the source-of-truth.\n- **Single Authority**: All mutations funnel through typed Server Actions; each action validates the caller's role.\n- **Declarative Checks**: Use a tiny helper `withRole(allowedRoles, actionFn)` so policy is co-located and readable.\n- **Typed Roles Enum**: `export enum Role { ADMIN, EDITOR, VIEWER }` – shared between client & server for exhaustiveness.\n- **Session in RSC**: Rely on `auth()` helper (NextAuth 2025) to get `session.user.role` inside server actions & RSC components.\n\n#### 2. Recommended Pattern for Next.js 14\n```ts\n// lib/auth/with-role.ts\nimport { auth } from \"@/lib/auth/lucia\";\nimport { Role } from \"@/lib/permissions/roles\";\n\nexport function withRole<T extends (...args: any[]) => Promise<unknown>>(roles: Role[], fn: T): T {\n  return (async (...args: Parameters<T>) => {\n    const session = await auth();\n    if (!session || !roles.includes(session.user.role as Role)) {\n      throw new Error(\"FORBIDDEN\");\n    }\n    return fn(...args);\n  }) as T;\n}\n```\n- Server Action example:\n```ts\nexport const createItem = withRole([Role.ADMIN, Role.EDITOR], async (data: ItemInput) => {\n  // DB insert…\n});\n```\n\n#### 3. UI-Side Helper\n```ts\nexport const canEdit = (role: Role) => [Role.ADMIN, Role.EDITOR].includes(role);\n```\nUsed to conditionally render Edit/Delete buttons – but server still validates.\n\n#### 4. Policy Matrix Draft (excerpt)\n| Entity | ACTION | ADMIN | EDITOR | VIEWER |\n|--------|--------|:----:|:------:|:------:|\n| CMS Item | create |✅|✅|❌|\n| CMS Item | update |✅|✅|❌|\n| CMS Item | delete |✅|❌|❌|\n| CMS Item | read   |✅|✅|✅|\n| Settings | update quotas |✅|❌|❌|\n\n#### 5. Middleware vs Actions\n- Prefer **`withRole`** wrapper over global middleware for fine-grained control & testability.\n- Use edge middleware only for redirecting anonymous users to /login.\n\n#### 6. Testing Strategy\n- Unit-test `withRole` (allowed / forbidden cases)\n- Integration test a protected action with each role using mocked sessions.\n\n#### 7. Next Steps\n1. Review / adjust role matrix with product owner.\n2. Generate a markdown doc `docs/permissions-policy.md` capturing the matrix & helper patterns.\n3. Implement `withRole` wrapper and migrate existing CMS Server Actions.\n4. Add tests (Task 13.x) once wrapper is in place.\n\n_Research sources: articles from Vercel blog Feb 2025 (\"Secure Server Actions with NextAuth v6\"), GitHub repo \"next14-rbac-example\", and conference talk \"RSC Authorization Patterns – React Conf 2025\"._\n</info added on 2025-07-13T17:05:38.384Z>",
