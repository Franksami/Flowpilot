# Task ID: 17
# Title: Design Staging Deployment Plan for FlowPilot
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a comprehensive staging deployment strategy for FlowPilot, including platform evaluation, environment management, and CI/CD pipeline design with preview deployments.
# Details:
Conduct a thorough evaluation of deployment platforms (Vercel, AWS Amplify, Fly.io) analyzing factors including: build performance, pricing models, geographic distribution, integration capabilities, and Next.js optimization. Create detailed comparison matrix covering deployment speed, scalability, cost at different usage tiers, and developer experience. Design environment variable and secret management strategy using platform-native solutions (Vercel Environment Variables, AWS Parameter Store, Fly.io Secrets) with proper separation between staging and production environments. Implement secure API key storage using encrypted environment variables and establish rotation procedures. Develop CI/CD pipeline architecture using GitHub Actions with automated workflows for: pull request preview deployments, staging environment updates on main branch merges, and production deployment gates. Configure branch protection rules and deployment approval processes. Design preview deployment strategy with unique URLs for each PR, automatic cleanup of stale deployments, and integration with GitHub PR status checks. Include rollback procedures, health check endpoints, and monitoring setup for each environment. Document deployment procedures, troubleshooting guides, and emergency response protocols.

# Test Strategy:
Validate platform evaluation by deploying test applications to each candidate platform and measuring build times, cold start performance, and feature compatibility. Test environment variable management by deploying with different configurations and verifying proper isolation between environments. Validate CI/CD pipeline by creating test pull requests and verifying preview deployments are created automatically with correct environment variables. Test rollback procedures by intentionally deploying broken code and verifying quick recovery. Verify secret management by rotating API keys and confirming seamless application functionality. Conduct load testing on staging environment to validate scalability assumptions and performance benchmarks.
