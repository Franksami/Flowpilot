# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Command Palette
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a command palette for quick navigation and actions.
# Details:
Use Shadcn/UI to create a command palette accessible via `Cmd+K`. Implement search and navigation for CMS collections. Add actions for creating new items and publishing sites.

# Test Strategy:
Test command palette functionality for navigation and action execution. Ensure keyboard shortcuts trigger the correct actions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Palette UI [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the visual and interactive interface for the command palette using Shadcn/UI components. Ensure the palette is visually accessible, overlays the main UI, and supports both mouse and keyboard navigation.
### Details:
Focus on modal/dialog presentation, input field for search, and a list for displaying filtered commands. Style with Tailwind CSS for consistency with the rest of the application.

## 2. Implement Keyboard Shortcut Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Enable global keyboard shortcut (Cmd+K) to open and focus the command palette from anywhere in the application. Ensure keyboard navigation within the palette (arrow keys, Enter, Esc) is intuitive and robust.
### Details:
Bind the shortcut at the application root. Handle focus management and prevent conflicts with existing shortcuts. Support closing the palette with Esc and navigating commands with arrow keys.

## 3. Develop Search and Navigation Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Implement dynamic search and filtering of commands and CMS collections within the palette. Support fuzzy search, context awareness, and sorting by relevance or popularity.
### Details:
Integrate fuzzy search algorithms for flexible matching. Filter commands based on current app context and user permissions. Display results in real time as the user types.

## 4. Integrate Action Execution (Create/Publish) [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Wire up command palette actions to trigger navigation, creation of new items, and site publishing. Ensure actions execute correctly and provide feedback to the user.
### Details:
Connect palette commands to existing CMS and publishing APIs. Handle success and error states, and update UI accordingly. Support both navigation and direct action execution from the palette.

## 5. Conduct Accessibility Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4
### Description: Test the command palette for accessibility, ensuring it meets WCAG standards. Validate keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and sufficient contrast.
### Details:
Use accessibility testing tools and manual testing to verify focus management, ARIA roles, and keyboard-only operation. Address any issues found to ensure an inclusive experience.
