# Task ID: 11
# Title: Optimize Performance with Next.js Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance application performance using Next.js 14.x optimization features and Core Web Vitals optimization.
# Details:
Implement Next.js 14.x performance features including React Server Components, static generation with generateStaticParams, enhanced data fetching with built-in memoization, and Turbopack support. Focus on Core Web Vitals optimization (LCP, INP, CLS) with proper loading states, Suspense boundaries, and optimistic UI patterns.

# Test Strategy:
Measure Core Web Vitals (LCP, INP, CLS) before and after optimizations using tools like Lighthouse and Web Vitals extension. Conduct bundle analysis to verify JavaScript reduction. Test loading states and Suspense boundaries for improved UX. Ensure static generation works correctly with generateStaticParams.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate React Server Components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement React Server Components in the Next.js 14.x app to offload rendering from the client and reduce JavaScript bundle size.
### Details:
Refactor eligible components to server components, ensuring data fetching and rendering logic are handled on the server where possible.

## 2. Implement Static Generation with generateStaticParams [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Set up static generation for pages using generateStaticParams to pre-render content at build time.
### Details:
Identify routes suitable for static generation and implement generateStaticParams to optimize build-time rendering.

## 3. Optimize Data Fetching and Memoization [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Enhance data fetching strategies using built-in memoization and caching to minimize redundant requests and improve performance.
### Details:
Leverage Next.js data fetching patterns and memoization to cache frequently used data and reduce server load.

## 4. Set Up Turbopack for Faster Builds [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Configure Turbopack as the build tool to accelerate development and production builds.
### Details:
Replace or configure the build pipeline to use Turbopack, ensuring compatibility with existing Next.js features.

## 5. Implement Dynamic Imports for Code Splitting [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Use dynamic imports to enable code splitting and lazy loading of non-critical components.
### Details:
Identify large or infrequently used components and refactor them to load dynamically using Next.js dynamic imports with custom loading states.

## 6. Optimize Images and Fonts [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Apply Next.js image and font optimization techniques to improve loading times and Core Web Vitals.
### Details:
Use the next/image component for responsive, optimized images and configure font loading strategies to minimize layout shifts and delays.

## 7. Monitor Core Web Vitals [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up continuous monitoring for Core Web Vitals (LCP, INP, CLS) to track performance improvements.
### Details:
Integrate tools like Lighthouse and the Web Vitals extension to measure and report on key performance metrics before and after optimizations.

## 8. Implement Loading States for Asynchronous Content [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.5
### Description: Design and implement user-friendly loading states for all asynchronous data and component loads.
### Details:
Ensure all dynamic and lazy-loaded components display appropriate loading indicators to improve perceived performance.

## 9. Add Suspense Boundaries [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Wrap asynchronous and lazy-loaded components with Suspense boundaries to manage loading and error states.
### Details:
Use React Suspense to provide fallback UIs and prevent layout shifts during data fetching or component loading.

## 10. Implement Optimistic UI Patterns [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.3
### Description: Apply optimistic UI updates for user interactions that trigger data mutations, improving responsiveness.
### Details:
Update the UI immediately on user actions while awaiting server confirmation, then reconcile with actual results.

## 11. Conduct Bundle Analysis [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.5, 11.6
### Description: Analyze the JavaScript bundle to identify and address sources of bloat and unnecessary code.
### Details:
Use Next.js bundle analyzer to inspect bundle size, identify large dependencies, and optimize imports.

## 12. Set Up Performance Regression Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.7, 11.11
### Description: Establish automated performance regression tests to ensure ongoing optimizations are maintained.
### Details:
Integrate performance testing into CI/CD pipelines, comparing Core Web Vitals and bundle sizes across deployments.

## 13. Performance Profiling & Optimization Plan [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Profile current pages with Lighthouse, next analyze, and React Profiler; research 2025 best-practice optimization techniques (Turbopack flags, RSC streaming, INP fixes); produce a ranked action-item plan.
