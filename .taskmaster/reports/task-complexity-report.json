		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Project Repository",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 12,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down each configuration and setup step into atomic subtasks: repository creation, Next.js initialization, TypeScript strict mode, Tailwind CSS setup, Zustand integration, Next.js optimizations, code quality tools, environment variable structure, security configurations, .gitignore, and CI/CD pipeline. Add a subtask for initial documentation of setup steps.",
			"reasoning": "This task covers a broad range of foundational setup activities, each with its own configuration nuances and best practices. The presence of multiple technologies and the need for security and CI/CD integration increase both cyclomatic and cognitive complexity. Expanding to include documentation ensures maintainability and onboarding ease."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Onboarding & Secure Connection",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand each security and onboarding concern into granular subtasks: UI flow design, input validation, API proxy implementation, secure token storage, token refresh logic, CSP and security headers, error handling, and end-to-end onboarding testing.",
			"reasoning": "Security-sensitive onboarding flows require careful handling of API keys, secure storage, and robust validation. Each aspect (UI, backend, storage, validation, security headers) introduces independent complexity paths and must be isolated for thorough implementation and testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Dynamic CMS Hub",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into subtasks for CMS data fetching, paginated/searchable table UI, CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete), optimistic UI updates, error handling, integration with state management, permissions/access control, and comprehensive testing.",
			"reasoning": "A dynamic CMS hub involves complex data flows, UI state, and real-time updates. Each CRUD operation and UI feature (pagination, search, optimistic updates) adds to cyclomatic and cognitive complexity. Proper separation ensures maintainability and testability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Centralized State Management with Zustand",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for store initialization, state slicing, selective subscriptions, immer integration, devtools setup, persistence middleware, optimistic updates, server component compatibility, and atomic update patterns.",
			"reasoning": "Modern state management with advanced patterns (slicing, selective subscriptions, optimistic updates) and compatibility with React Server Components introduces moderate to high complexity. Each pattern should be implemented and tested independently."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate AI Content Co-Pilot",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for Claude API integration, prompt engineering, tone matching logic, UI for 'Ask AI', CMS field insertion, alt-text generation, and AI output validation/testing.",
			"reasoning": "Integrating AI for content generation involves external API communication, prompt design, UI/UX, and ensuring safe, contextually relevant outputs. Each step is a potential source of defects and requires isolated implementation and validation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Build Dashboard 'Mission Control'",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for dashboard layout, site stats integration, recent items display, AI suggestions integration, API data fetching, and dashboard testing.",
			"reasoning": "The dashboard aggregates multiple data sources and features, requiring careful UI composition and data synchronization. Each feature (stats, recent items, AI suggestions) should be implemented and tested separately for clarity and maintainability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Command Palette",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into subtasks for palette UI, keyboard shortcut handling, search/navigation logic, action execution (create/publish), and accessibility testing.",
			"reasoning": "Command palettes are moderately complex, involving keyboard event handling, dynamic search, and action dispatch. Each concern should be isolated to ensure robust implementation and cross-browser compatibility."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Enhance Pro Workflow with Keyboard Shortcuts",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for shortcut mapping, event listener implementation, cross-browser compatibility testing, and user documentation.",
			"reasoning": "Keyboard shortcut implementation is straightforward but requires careful handling of browser differences and potential conflicts. Testing and documentation are essential for usability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Professional WYSIWYG Editor",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for TipTap integration, editor customization, CMS field binding, compatibility testing with Webflow, and accessibility enhancements.",
			"reasoning": "Integrating and customizing a rich text editor involves moderate complexity, especially for ensuring compatibility with CMS data structures and accessibility standards."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Site Publishing Controls",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for UI design, Webflow API integration, real-time status feedback, error handling, and publishing flow testing.",
			"reasoning": "Site publishing involves API integration and real-time feedback, each requiring careful implementation and error handling to ensure reliability and user trust."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Optimize Performance with Next.js Features",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 12,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into subtasks for React Server Components, static generation, data fetching optimization, Turbopack setup, dynamic imports, image/font optimization, Core Web Vitals monitoring, loading states, Suspense boundaries, optimistic UI, bundle analysis, and performance regression testing.",
			"reasoning": "Performance optimization with modern Next.js features is highly complex, involving multiple independent and interrelated concerns. Each optimization area should be addressed and validated separately to ensure measurable improvements."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Secure Local Storage for API Key",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for encryption library integration, encryption logic implementation, decryption logic, and security testing.",
			"reasoning": "Securing local storage with encryption is a focused task but requires careful implementation and testing to avoid exposing sensitive data."

			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for test framework setup, unit test development, integration test development, edge case coverage, CI integration, coverage reporting, and test maintenance documentation.",
			"reasoning": "A comprehensive testing suite spans multiple test types and integration points. Each aspect (framework, unit, integration, CI, reporting) should be handled as a distinct subtask for thorough coverage."
